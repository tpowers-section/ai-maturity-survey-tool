    ### How to use this tool:
    
    1. **Add Data**: Place your client survey Excel files in the `data` folder (using the **Raw Data** sheet)
    2. **Add Rating Column**: Make sure your Raw Data sheet has a "Rating" column (in row 2) with values like "AI Expert", "AI Practitioner", etc.
    3. **Create Industry Mapping**: Create `client_industry_mapping.xlsx` with columns 'Client' and 'Industry'
    4. **Load Data**: Click "Refresh Data" in the sidebar
    5. **View Proficiency**: Check the Proficiency Overview tab for distribution analysis
    6. **Explore Questions**: Use the Question Explorer tab to analyze individual questions with filters
    7. **View Demographics**: Analyze the demographic breakdown of respondents
    8. **Access Raw Data**: View and download the complete dataset
    9. **Export**: Download filtered data and summary statistics
    
    ### Raw Data Sheet Structure:
    - **Row 1**: (ignored)
    - **Row 2**: Column headers/questions (must include "Rating" column)
    - **Row 3+**: Response data
    
    ### Features:
    - ✅ Proficiency Overview dashboard with metrics and visualizations
    - ✅ Automatically loads all client surveys from one location
    - ✅ Filter by client, industry, and AI proficiency level
    - ✅ Visualize response distributions with charts
    - ✅ Handle single-select, multi-select, and free-response questions
    - ✅ Response validation and filtering to remove contaminated data
    - ✅ Automatic True/False to Yes/No conversion for display
    - ✅ Export filtered data and summaries
    - ✅ Toggle between Scored Questions and Organizational Readiness questions
    
    ### Setup Instructions:
    
    **For the person managing the data (Taylor):**
    1. Create a folder called `data` in the same location as this app
    2. Add all your client Excel files to that folder (must have "Raw Data" sheet)
    3. Make sure each file has a "Rating" column in row 2 of the Raw Data sheet
    4. Create `client_industry_mapping.xlsx` with two columns: 'Client' and 'Industry'
    5. Click "Refresh Data" to load everything
    
    **For everyone else:**
    - Just use the app! All data is already loaded
    - Filter and analyze without worrying about uploading files
    
    ### Adding New Surveys:
    1. Add new Excel file to the `data` folder (must have "Raw Data" sheet with "Rating" column in row 2)
    2. Add client name and industry to `client_industry_mapping.xlsx`
    3. Click "Refresh Data" in the sidebar
    4. New data appears instantly for everyone
