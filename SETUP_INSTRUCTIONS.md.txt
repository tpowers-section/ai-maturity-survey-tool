# Setup Instructions - READ THIS FIRST!## What ChangedThe app now **automatically loads data from a folder** instead of requiring users to upload files. This means:✅ You control all the data in one place  ✅ Your team just uses the app - no file uploads needed  ✅ Adding new surveys is as simple as dropping a file in a folder  ✅ Everyone always sees the same, up-to-date data---## Initial Setup (5 minutes)### Step 1: Create the Data FolderIn the same folder where you have `survey_app.py`, create a new folder called **`data`** (all lowercase).Your folder structure should look like:```Your App Folder/├── survey_app.py├── requirements.txt├── README.md├── data/                    ← NEW! Create this folder│   ├── Havas__Survey.xlsx   ← Put your Excel files here│   ├── ClientB__Survey.xlsx│   └── ClientC__Survey.xlsx```### Step 2: Add Your Survey Files1. Copy all your client survey Excel files into the `data` folder2. Files should have the "Raw Data" sheet with questions as headers3. Name them however you want - the app extracts the client name automatically   - Examples: `Havas__AI_Survey.xlsx`, `ClientName_2025.xlsx`### Step 3: Test It Locally1. Open Terminal2. Navigate to your app folder: `cd Documents/Data\ App\ Vibe\ Code`3. Run: `streamlit run survey_app.py`4. In the sidebar, click "Refresh Data"5. You should see all your surveys loaded!---## Adding New Surveys (30 seconds)When you complete a new client survey:1. Save the Excel file to the `data` folder2. **That's it!**    - If you're running locally: click "Refresh Data" in the sidebar   - If deployed to Streamlit Cloud: push to GitHub (see deployment guide)---## Deploying for Your Team (15-20 minutes)So everyone at Section can access this without running it on your computer:### Option 1: Streamlit Community Cloud (FREE - Recommended)**Prerequisites:**- GitHub account (free)- Your app folder with all files + data folder**Steps:**1. **Create a GitHub Repository**   - Go to https://github.com   - Click the "+" icon → "New repository"   - Name it: `ai-maturity-survey-tool`   - **Make it Private** (important - your data is confidential)   - Don't initialize with README   - Click "Create repository"2. **Upload Your Files to GitHub**      **Option A: Via GitHub Website (Easiest)**   - On your new repo page, click "uploading an existing file"   - Upload ALL files:     - survey_app.py     - requirements.txt     - README.md     - run_app.bat / run_app.sh   - Create a folder called `data` (click "Create new file", type `data/.gitkeep`)   - Upload all your Excel files to the `data` folder   - Click "Commit changes"   **Option B: Via Terminal (if you're comfortable)**   ```bash   cd Documents/Data\ App\ Vibe\ Code   git init   git add .   git commit -m "Initial commit"   git branch -M main   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-maturity-survey-tool.git   git push -u origin main   ```3. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io   - Click "Sign in with GitHub"   - Click "New app"   - Select:     - Repository: `ai-maturity-survey-tool`     - Branch: `main`     - Main file path: `survey_app.py`   - Click "Deploy"   - Wait 2-3 minutes while it builds4. **Share with Your Team**   - Copy the URL (will be something like: `your-app-name.streamlit.app`)   - Share with Section team   - Anyone with the link can access it   - Data is automatically loaded from your `data` folder**Adding New Surveys After Deployment:**When deployed to Streamlit Cloud:1. Add new Excel file to your local `data` folder2. Push to GitHub:   ```bash   cd Documents/Data\ App\ Vibe\ Code   git add data/new_client_file.xlsx   git commit -m "Add new client survey"   git push   ```3.
